Welcome to Buddy Boddy!

This application is used for tracking trainers and workouts.
You can monitor what workouts you add as well as who is teaching them.

Users are able to create your own profile or log in via Github.

On the user profile page, you can see what workouts you have added.

To use simply clone the repository, run 'bundle install', and then start up a local server with 'rails s'.
